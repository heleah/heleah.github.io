## My Portfolio Website

On this website, I am displaying information about myself, projects I have worked on, and also certificates from successfully completed online courses in the field of Web Development.

I am constantly working on updating and adding projects to the portfolio.
As my main source for learning Web Development has been Codecademy, currently all displayed projects are from there. That will change with time.
I might also change the looks and layout of the website at some point.
There will also be an English version soon.
